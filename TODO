-port to DirectX
  -let the gpu do the skinning(check tutorials of 2018 for the better aproach)
  -let D3D do the split screen, and add 3D glasses(as a feature)
  -add shaders(look at Renderer on the 2010 project, for an easy example on how to do shaders the easy way)
  -add brain computer interface(buy one from TAGL)
